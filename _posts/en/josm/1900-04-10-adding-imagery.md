JOSM - Adding Aerial Imagery
================

Not all aerial imagery is within the JOSM imagery menu, but it is easy to add if you have been given the link information. In this example we are working from the [HOT Tasking Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) and the imagery required to complete one of the projects needs to be manually added to JOSM. There are also occassions when the intended links do not work as expected and it may be necessary to add the imagery manually.  

From the Tasking Manager information tab, copy all of the information contained within the Imagery section.

Go to the Preferences menu of JOSM (**Edit / Preferences**, or on an Apple machine **JOSM / Preferences**)  

![Preferences WMS TMS 1][]

Click on the ![WMS_TMS_button][]{: height="24px"}, and in this case the ![+TMS_button][]{: height="24px"} icon.  

![Preferences WMS TMS 3][]

**Box 1.** Paste the information you copied from the Tasking Manager information tab into the first box on the window. JOSM will verify it, and if it is correct will repeat the information in box 3. If it does not appear in box 3 within a few seconds, check that you have not accidentally missed letters, or accidentally added 'white space' at the beginning or end - just the actual link must be copied and pasted.  
**Box 2.** is normally left blank, unless you have received any other instructions.  
**Box 3.** now contains a duplicate copy of box 1, generated by the verificiation process within JOSM.  
**Box 4.** Enter a name for the layer - as my imagery was identified in the Tasking Manager as "Satellite imagery for this project is kindly provided by Digital Globe through their +Vivid service." I have named my layer "Digital Globe + Vivid".  

![Preferences WMS TMS 4][]

Click on the **Okay** button, and the imagery you have added will appear at the bottom of the list - you may have to scroll down to locate it.  

![Preferences WMS TMS 5][]

Click on the **Okay** button to close the preferences window and return to JOSM. When you need to use the imagery, click on the word **Imagery** in the menu at the top of the screen and select it from the alphabetical list. Alternatively **Alt + I** should show the imagery menu (These shortcuts may vary according to the language setting).
