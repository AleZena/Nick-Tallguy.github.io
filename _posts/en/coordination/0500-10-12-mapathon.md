# Manage a Mapathon

FIRST STEP â€“ 
------------

What type of event  
Deciding on what type of event you want to host will decide the direction you need to go and the steps you need to take.  

This Guide deals with indoor Mapathons for larger groups. 

For other types of gatherings for mapping see  
[Weekend Mapping Projects - ](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Weekend_mapping_projects)  
[Mapping Parties - ](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties)  

**A Mapathon is an organised gathering of people to add data to the OpenStreetMap. This can be a project to improve the map in your local area, or to help Response Teams on the ground during a Disaster, or a Missing Maps Project for ongoing or future Humanitarian Responses.**  

Your Mapathon can be open to training new mappers as well as a regular event for experienced mappers and could consist of a training session, mapping time and socialising time.  

While we can give general guidelines on how to organise a Mapathon, your event will evolve and develop it's own structure and identity depending on the people who organise it, the venues available and the people that turn up to map.  

Start working on your Mapathon to allow for a month before for organising and preparing the event.  

### First step.  

The size of the available venues and the availability of facilities at the venue will decide the factors for your Mapathon. A venue can be a local company, University or school, arts centre, library, hall. The points to note:  

1.  Is the venue centrally situated and easy to get to? (note public transport or parking)  
2.  Does it have good wi-fi that can handle up to 100 simultaneous connections?  
3.  Can it hold up to 100 mappers? This will decide the number of people invited.  
4.  Are there sufficient and suitable tables and chairs?  
5.  Are there sufficient power points for charging laptops? (arrange for extension cables)  
6.  Does it have a large overhead screen for tutorials and presentations.  

### Planning the Mapathon

Now that you have enough information from your first steps to decide the numbers, location and available dates you can start planning your Mapathon.  

1.  Set the date and time for the Mapathon in line with availability of venues (Be careful to check that it does not clash with some other major event that would affect you being able to attract volunteers and mappers to your event). Allow at least 2.5 to 3 hours minimum for your event (half an hour for speeches and training, half an hour for refreshments, two hours for mapping).  
2.  Book the venue. Make sure the venue is on Openstreetmap.  
3.  Distribute invites to Mappers through local and online media to aim for good attendance.  
4.  Will you be providing snacks/refreshments at the event?  
5.  Set up a task/tasks for the event. Suggest that you have two easy tasks for beginners and two more challenging tasks for more experienced mappers. Contact the Missing Maps Project if you need help with setting up tasks and also for Mapathon materials for the tables and direction signs for the corridors.  
6.  Suggested helpers that you will need for the event  
  *    An experienced person to talk them through the procedures  
  *    An IT person from the venue to trouble shoot any connectivity problems.  
  *    A guest speaker to talk about their experiences with Openstreetmap  
  *    One experienced mapper per table to check that they understand the task and to answer any questions. Contact the Missing Maps Project  and also check for experienced mappers in your area using <http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/oooc>  
  *    A deputy to help with the arrangements and stand in for you as a back up.  
  *    Have someone available from the local media to take photos and report the event.  
7.  Add your event to the Mapathon calendar.  

### The week before the Mapathon

1.  Visit the venue and check that all the arrangements are still in place. (venue, helpers, equipment).  
2.  Compile a list of attendees for messaging and for Identity tags for the event.  
3.  Send out message to attendees reminding them to bring laptop and mouse and have their Openstreetmap account set up, their log in details with them, and JOSM downloaded if that is their choice of editor.  
4.  Post notices on line, with links to the ticket allocation, reminding attendees to take up the last remaining spaces at your event.  
5.  Plan the layout for postioning of tables and chairs in respect to available power points and view of the large overhead screen.  
6.  Check that you have current mapping projects for the event.  
7.  Check that you have funding for the refreshments and any other costs.  
8.  Check that someone will be bringing any equipment and table aids that will be needed.  
9.  Notify your helpers that you need them to be at the venue half an hour before the start to help put out the tables, chairs, extension cords, etc.  
10.  Check that there is a log in to the wi-fi at the venue and a password is available for all to use.  

### At the Mapathon

1. Arrive early at the venue to check that reception is all primed and prepared for the event.  
2. Walk round the venue to familiarise yourself with the area, toilets, emergency exits, etc.  
3. Brief the helpers as to the layout of the room and get your deputy to oversee them on setting out the tables and chairs and equipment, putting up direction signs in the corridors.  
4. Check with the resident IT person that the internet connections are all working and the overhead large screens are connected to the relevant laptops.
5. Have one helper at the door to welcome the mappers and tell them where to sit.
6. Have helpers moving from table to table helping mappers to log on when they arrive.

### Start the Event

1. Quieten everone down and start your welcome and introduction speech.
2. Introduce your Experienced Mapper and start the Training process.
3. Check that the refreshments are in place for the mid-session break.
4. Decide on a local pub for the meet up afterwards and check that it is on Openstreetmap.
5. Check that the local media or/and a helper is taking photos.

### At the end of the Event

1. Thank the hosts for the great venue, the new mappers for coming along and joining the mapping community, the experienced mappers for their help and for their time and contributions, show them the progress that was made on the tasks they worked on, ask them to come back to the next Mapathon and invite them to the pub afterwards.
2. Make sure the tables and chairs are put back and the venue is in a clean condition before leaving for the pub.
