Mapping with the Tasking Manager
================

HOT (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) works with many organisations, Aid Agencies, and charities to provide mapping data where it is needed, often related to some kind of disaster. This is different to the mapping which normally takes place, where you map your local area, or an area that you can visit, survey, and then update with some degree of certainty.  

This chapter will give you the tools to start mapping quickly, and will give you a staged approach so that you can learn whilst contributing. 

We would like to get you mapping as soon as possible, but if you have never looked at satellite imagery before, and you are worried about your ability to find buildings, you may like to download the Mapswipe app to your phone and scan a few areas for buildings - this will give you a much better idea of how buildings can look.
