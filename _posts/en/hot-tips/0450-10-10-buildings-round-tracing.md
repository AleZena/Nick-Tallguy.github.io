> This image ![keymon]{: height="24px"} shows you which buttons or wheel on a mouse has been used, and which keyboard buttons pressed.  

![bush-and-round-building][]  
This image shows both a bush and a round building. The instructions to this particular task include a [link to a diary entry](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/IvanGayton/diary/38612) by someone who has taken photographs of the buildings in the area, and gives a description. Please take the time to read this information. 
Shadows can help you to identify if you are looking at a round building, or a bush. Round buildings can have slightly different construction materials in other areas of the world, and their roofs will appear different - the project instructions will often include guides to help you understand what you are seeing.  
Do your best - even the experts will disagree sometimes, and sometimes you just have to go there to see exactly what is really there. **If in doubt add it as a building.**
