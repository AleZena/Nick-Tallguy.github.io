HOT Tips - Getting started for new mappers using iD
================

You've read a few things and you know you want to map - if you haven't then check out  
<https://hotosm.org/>,   
<http://www.missingmaps.org/> or countless other sites that illustrate how much the aid agencies need mapping data. 

You can find more detailed information elsewhere in LearnOSM, but as a quick start;  

1.  Get an account from <http://www.openstreetmap.org> and keep a note of your username and password,  
2.  Go to <http://tasks.hotosm.org/> or any other Tasking Manager you've been sent to - login with your details from OpenStreetMap & authorise your account.  
3.  Find a project to work on & read the information under the **Description** and **Instructions** tab. If you need it, more info in [LearnOSM on Tasking Manager](/en/coordination/tasking-manager/)  
4.  You map and someone checks your work - okay let's make it easy for them (we call them a validator) - they're also a volunteer and they're there to help you become a great mapper.  
5.  We need you to do more mapping!  Learn from your mistakes (we all make them). Keep coming back to us - map a bit and read a bit more, then map a bit. It takes time, practice and patience to become a great mapper. If you get feedback it's because we want you to map more and are trying to help you to help us. There are mappers from around the world volunteering for or with [The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://hotosm.org/) (HOT) and there are many languages used - sometimes the message is short because translation is difficult!   

Now a few tips just to make sure everyone gets what they need. Checkout the following chapters in this section. Feel free to read more in LearnOSM or elsewhere, but really, read a bit, map a bit, then read a bit - you learn as you map.  

If you follow the guidance in this chapter, you should be able to complete your first square within a simple Tasking Manager Task & it will provide you with a basic foundation on which to build your knowledge. Guidance is given on; how to correctly map buildings, checking that your mapping has been 'tagged', mapping a round building, and many other subjects.
