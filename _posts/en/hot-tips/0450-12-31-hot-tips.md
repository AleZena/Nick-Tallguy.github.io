HOT Tips - Getting started for new mappers using iD and a Tasking Manager
================

This series of short guides is aimed at new mappers who wish to contribute to the mapping data within OpenStreetMap. Mapping is easy,  but let's get it right so the data is good.  

In this **HOT Tips** section you will find information on;  

- [Getting Started with a Tasking Manager](/en/hot-tips/getting-started/). *A more detailed guide to using a Tasking Manager is available at [LearnOSM - Tasking Manager](/en/coordination//tasking-manager/).*  
<!-- - [Zooming to the details](/en/hot-tips/zoom/) which gives a few notes of guidance on what scale to inspect an area at, and what scale to zoom to when tracing.  -->
- [Tracing Rectangular Buildings](/en/hot-tips/tracing-rectangular-buildings/)  
- [Tracing Round Buildings](/en/hot-tips/tracing-round-buildings/)  
- [Saving your work - changeset comments, hashtags & marking a square as complete, or that you are stopping mapping](/en/hot-tips/saving/)  
- [Speeding things up with copy, paste & rotate](/en/hot-tips/copy-paste/)  
<!--  - [Finding & identifying Buildings](/en/hot-tips/finding-buildings/) -->

Elsewhere in LearnOSM you will find information on many different aspects of OpenStreetMap, but don't forget there is also an [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) and much of the information there may be more detailed or even more up to date!  

<!--You've read a few things and you know you want to map - if you haven't then check out  
<https://hotosm.org/>,   
<http://www.missingmaps.org/> or countless other sites that illustrate how much the aid agencies need mapping data. 

You can find more detailed information elsewhere in LearnOSM, but as a quick start;  

1.  Get an account from <http://www.openstreetmap.org> and keep a note of your username and password,  
2.  Go to <http://tasks.hotosm.org/> or any other Tasking Manager you've been sent to - login with your details from OpenStreetMap & authorise your account.  
3.  Find a project to work on & read the information under the **Description** and **Instructions** tab. If you need it, more info in [LearnOSM on Tasking Manager](/en/coordination/tasking-manager/)  
4.  You map and someone checks your work - okay let's make it easy for them (we call them a validator) - they're also a volunteer and they're there to help you become a great mapper.  
5.  We need you to do more mapping!  Learn from your mistakes (we all make them). Keep coming back to us - map a bit and read a bit more, then map a bit. It takes time, practice and patience to become a great mapper. If you get feedback it's because we want you to map more and are trying to help you to help us. There are mappers from around the world volunteering for or with [The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://hotosm.org/) (HOT) and there are many languages used - sometimes the message is short because translation is difficult!   

Now a few tips just to make sure everyone gets what they need. Checkout the following chapters in this section. Feel free to read more in LearnOSM or elsewhere, but really, read a bit, map a bit, then read a bit - you learn as you map.  

If you follow the guidance in this chapter, you should be able to complete your first square within a simple Tasking Manager Task & it will provide you with a basic foundation on which to build your knowledge. Guidance is given on; how to correctly map buildings, checking that your mapping has been 'tagged', mapping a round building, and many other subjects.-->
