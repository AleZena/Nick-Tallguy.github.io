HOT Tips - Getting started for new mappers using iD and a Tasking Manager
================

This series of short guides is aimed at volunteers helping to map for Aid Agencies, but the principles are the same for all OpenStreetMap mapping. Mapping is easy,  but let's get it right so the data is good.  

In this **HOT Tips** section you will find information on;  

- [Getting Started with a Tasking Manager](/en/hot-tips/getting-started/). *A more detailed guide to using a Tasking Manager is available at [LearnOSM - Tasking Manager](/en/coordination//tasking-manager/).*  
<!-- - [Zooming to the details](/en/hot-tips/zoom/) which gives a few notes of guidance on what scale to inspect an area at, and what scale to zoom to when tracing.  -->
- [Tracing Rectangular Buildings](/en/hot-tips/tracing-rectangular-buildings/)  
- [Tracing Round Buildings](/en/hot-tips/tracing-round-buildings/)  
- [Saving your work to OpenStreetMap, changeset comments, and hashtags. Tasking Manager - marking a square as complete, or that you are stopping mapping](/en/hot-tips/saving/)  
- [Tagging - a line is just a line until you tell the software it's a road or boundary!](/en/hot-tips/tagging/)  
- [Copy, paste and rotate](/en/hot-tips/copy-paste/)  
- [Highways and networks](/en/hot-tips/network/)  
- [Changing the colours or brightness within iD to make mapping easier](/en/hot-tips/enhance/)
<!--  - [Finding & identifying Buildings](/en/hot-tips/finding-buildings/) -->

Elsewhere in LearnOSM you will find information on many different aspects of OpenStreetMap.
