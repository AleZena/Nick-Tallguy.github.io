HOT Tips - Getting started for new mappers using iD and a Tasking Manager
================

This series of short guides is aimed at volunteers helping to map for Aid Agencies using a Tasking Manager, but the principles are the same for all OpenStreetMap mapping. Mapping is easy,  but let's get it right and keep improving the map!

Use the menu to choose the order that suits you.
