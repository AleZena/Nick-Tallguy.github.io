Save your work regularly. Perhaps after tracing 6 buildings. This is especially important at a mapathon when lots of people are all working on the same thing at the same time.  

If you have been given a **#hashtag** to include in your work, the changeset comment shown in the image above is the place to put it. Also add a simple comment explaining what you have done at the end of the existing comments, for instance "**added a couple of buildings**".  

Finishing a square, or stopping work before the square is finished  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When you think the square is finished, return to the Tasking Manager tab on your browser, add a comment & mark the square as complete. You do not need to copy the changeset comment with hashtags which you used when saving.  
![mark task as done]{: height="250px"}  

If you have not finished mapping the square, leave a comment in the box and click **Stop mapping**
