![tagging][]

> This image ![keymon]{: height="24px"} shows you which buttons or wheel on a mouse has been used, and which keyboard buttons pressed.  

Without a tag an item has no meaning and maps will not show it. If you find something where the tag has been 'missed', please add the tag. If an item is tagged it will have a colour, such as the red hue to the building tagged in the image above. **If it's white investigate and add the tag if it's been missed.**  

![tagged-building][]
The author of the project in the Tasking Manager does not know which editor the mapper will be using, so the instructions can often have a comment similar to this;  

- Buildings are generally round huts and should be tagged as **Building Features / Building** in iD and **building=yes** in JOSM.  

If you need to check what tag is actually on an item, click on it, then scroll to the bottom of the tagging pane & look under **All Tags**
