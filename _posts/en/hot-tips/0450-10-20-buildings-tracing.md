Most buildings either have corners at 90 degrees, or they are round buildings.  

![building-ridge][]  
This building has 90 degree corners, but has a ridge on its roof. The camera angle initially makes the building look a strange shape.  

![building-tree-ridge][]  
This building has a tree partially obscuring it. It is a rectangular building.  

When tracing the building outline, you must try to trace the building at the right size, and at the point where its walls meet the ground - do your best! In many parts of the world, buildings are partially constructed and then left without roofs until they are sold, or otherwise wanted for use. Map a building without a roof as a normal building as it does not take long to add a roof, and the roof may have been added already, in the time since the satellite imagery was taken.  

Do your best - even the experts will disagree sometimes, and sometimes you just have to go there to see exactly what is really there. **If in doubt add it as a building.**
