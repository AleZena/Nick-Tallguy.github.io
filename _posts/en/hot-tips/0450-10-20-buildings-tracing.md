Buildings obscured or seen at an angle  
--------------------------------------

![building-obscured][]  

It is common for the satellite image to be taken at an angle making the building seem distorted. In the above image the image to the right shows how the building should be traced. It is often easiest to trace the outline of the roof, then drag this to the point where the walls meet the ground - this was the technique used to trace the building above. Notice also that a building partially obscured by trees has been correctly traced as rectangular. 

Buildings with a ridged roof
----------------------------
 
Most buildings either have corners at 90 degrees, or they are round buildings.  

![building-ridge][]  
This building has 90 degree corners, but has a ridge on its roof. The camera angle initially makes the building look a strange shape.  

![building-tree-ridge][]  
This building has a tree partially obscuring it. It is a rectangular building.  

When tracing the building outline, you must try to trace the building at the right size, and at the point where its walls meet the ground - do your best! In many parts of the world, buildings are partially constructed and then left without roofs until they are sold, or otherwise wanted for use. Map a building without a roof as a normal building as it does not take long to add a roof, and the roof may have been added already, in the time since the satellite imagery was taken.  

Do your best - even the experts will disagree sometimes, and sometimes you just have to go there to see exactly what is really there. **If in doubt add it as a building.**
