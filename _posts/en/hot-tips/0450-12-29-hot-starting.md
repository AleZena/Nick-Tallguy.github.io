We've all asked it when we were starting out "Am I doing it right?".  Most people then ask for feedback and the easiest & best way to get feedback is;  

1.  Start on a project designed for new mappers - these are often 'buildings only' projects.  
2.  Many validators start working at the top of the map and work down - use the map & select a square as close to the top as you can. (The yellow squares have been marked as complete, and the green ones have been marked as complete and then validated). Click on a white or pale grey square - more info at [Guide to the Tasking Manager](/en/coordination/tasking-manager/)

3.  Be patient - sometimes there is a shortage of validators and an abundance of new mappers all wanting feedback!  
4.  If you need to know how to identify the exact square you are working on, send a message, or obtain live feedback, please refer to the [Tasking Manager section of LearnOSM]/en/coordination/tasking-manager/)
