Starting with a Tasking Manager
============

This guide is written for the [HOT Tasking Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/), but the principles are the same for all versions.  

![TM Start][]

1. Go to a Tasking Manager (TM) site, for example <http://tasks.hotosm.org/>, using your <http://www.openstreetmap.org> login. Authorise the Tasking Manager to access your OpenStreetMap account,  
2.  Start on a project designed for new mappers - these are often 'buildings only' projects.  
3.  The data is checked by 'validators' who often send messages giving valuable feedback on your contributions. Many validators start working at the top of the map and work down - use the map & select a square as close to the top as you can. (The yellow squares have been marked as complete, and the green ones have been marked as complete and then validated). Click on a white or pale grey square - more info at [Guide to the Tasking Manager](/en/coordination/tasking-manager/)  
![TM-start-at-top][]
4.  Be patient - sometimes there is a shortage of validators and lots of new mappers all wanting feedback!  
5.  If you need to know how to identify the exact square you are working on, send a message, or obtain live feedback, please refer to the [Tasking Manager section of LearnOSM](/en/coordination/tasking-manager/)
